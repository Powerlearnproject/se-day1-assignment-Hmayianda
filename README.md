Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of designing and developing software application systems.
It has enabled businesses scale and grow rapidly as software usage increases in the global market. Developing great user experiences and customer-centered softwares as a key principle in Software engineering.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
a)Structured & object-oriented programming -  This emphasized on a structured way of creating software and storing data as objects that can be easily accessed.
b)Agile - This methodology enables software engineers to develop a system in an iterative, collaborative and flexible manner.
c)Big data -  Ability of machines to operate on large volumes of data involved in software engineering.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
a)Planning - This is the first phase, which involves defining the project scope and objectives.
b)Requirements gathering and analysis - This phase  involves, the software engineer collecting user requirements and performs an analysis for incoperation.
c)Design - This is the actual phase of creating the software and database design.
d)Test & Implementation - This phase involves testing the software designs and implementing the project.
e)Deployment - This phase involves releasing the software to the required end-users, ensuring it's accessible and functional.
f)Maintenance - The phase focuses on regular monitoring of the system and fixing any bug in the software.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology                                                  Agile Methodology
a)It is sequential and structured structured.                          a)It is iterative and flexible.
b)Rigid; difficult to change requirements once the project starts      b)Highly adaptable; allows changes at any stage
c)Testing is done at the end.                                          c)Continuous testing in each iteration.
Waterfall methodology could be well suited in Projects have well-defined, fixed requirements e.g Building a payroll processing system while agile methodology is well suited for projects such as AI-innovations that require insights and data.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer is the person responsible for the design and coding of the system being developed.
A Quality Assurance Engineer ensures that the software meets the required quality standards before release.
A Project Manager oversees the software development lifecycle, ensuring projects are completed on time, within scope, and within budget.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs give software developers a pplatform and enviroment to design, develop, code and test the software being developed. Example: VS Code
Version control systems enables software engineers to keep track of the software changes during development. example: Git


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
a)Debugging and Fixing Bugs - Software engineers need to use appropriate debugging tools and leverage the use of automation in fixing bugs.
b)Keeping Up with Rapidly Changing Technologies - Software engineers have to follow and keep track of new emerging technologies regulary.



Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
a)Unit testing - Tests individual components (functions, methods, classes) as units.
b)Integration testing - Tests interactions between multiple components or modules.
c)System testing - Tests the complete, integrated system as a whole.
d)Acceptance testing - Conducted by end-users or stakeholders to confirm the software meets business needs.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering - Is asking AI the correct and concise question inorder to receive a more accurate and specific answer.
Importance:
a)Improving Response Quality and Accuracy - Giving AI the correct and well-explained question will lead to a more accurate response.
b)Enhancing AI Efficiency - A well-crafted prompt reduces ambiguity, minimizing back-and-forth interactions


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt - "Design an Advert poster"
Impoved prompt - "Design an advertising poster for Safaricom Mpesa indicating their celebration of 18yrs and business and CSR activites it has empowered"
The improved prompt will enable the AI gain more details to design and have a specific niche to generate the poster.
